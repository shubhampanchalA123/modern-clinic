    **What It Means**  
    Homeopathy is a holistic medical science developed over 200 years ago by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann.  
    It works on the principle of “Like cures like”, meaning:  
    #a substance that produces symptoms in a healthy person can help treat similar symptoms in an unwell person when given in a highly diluted, potentized form.**

    **Key Concepts**  
    - Homeopathy treats the root cause, not just symptoms.  
    - Remedies stimulate the body's natural healing mechanism.  
    - Emotional, physical, and lifestyle factors are considered.  
    - Medicines are safe, non-toxic, and suitable for all ages.

    **Why It Matters**  
    Homeopathy aims to restore long-term health by correcting internal imbalances.  
    It is widely used for chronic conditions, allergies, emotional issues, and lifestyle disorders.

    **Clearing Common Misconceptions**  
    Many people confuse homeopathy with other natural systems.  
    Homeopathy is **not** synonymous with Ayurvedic oils, herbal remedies, or dietary supplements.

    **Homeopathy Is NOT:**  
    - **Not Herbal Medicine:** Remedies are potentized, not crude plant extracts.  
    - **Not Ayurvedic or Naturopathic Therapy:** Completely separate philosophy & pharmacology.  
    - **Not Placebo:** Studies show clinical benefits in chronic conditions.  
    - **Not Slow Always:** Acute problems like colds, injuries, allergies respond fast.

    **Why This Matters**  
    Understanding what homeopathy is NOT helps patients recognize its scientific structure and avoid misleading comparisons.
