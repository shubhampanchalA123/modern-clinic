        question: "What is Homeopathy?",
        answer: `
    ### What It Means  
    Homeopathy is a holistic medical science developed over 200 years ago by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann.  
    It works on the principle of “Like cures like”, meaning:  
    **a substance that produces symptoms in a healthy person can help treat similar symptoms in an unwell person when given in a highly diluted, potentized form.**

    ### Key Concepts  
    - Homeopathy treats the root cause, not just symptoms.  
    - Remedies stimulate the body's natural healing mechanism.  
    - Emotional, physical, and lifestyle factors are considered.  
    - Medicines are safe, non-toxic, and suitable for all ages.

    ### Why It Matters  
    Homeopathy aims to restore long-term health by correcting internal imbalances.  
    It is widely used for chronic conditions, allergies, emotional issues, and lifestyle disorders.

        question: "What Homeopathy is NOT",
        answer: `
    ### Clearing Common Misconceptions  
    Many people confuse homeopathy with other natural systems.  
    Homeopathy is **not** synonymous with Ayurvedic oils, herbal remedies, or dietary supplements.

    ### Homeopathy Is NOT:  
    - **Not Herbal Medicine:** Remedies are potentized, not crude plant extracts.  
    - **Not Ayurvedic or Naturopathic Therapy:** Completely separate philosophy & pharmacology.  
    - **Not Placebo:** Studies show clinical benefits in chronic conditions.  
    - **Not Slow Always:** Acute problems like colds, injuries, allergies respond fast.

    ### Why This Matters  
    Understanding what homeopathy is NOT helps patients recognize its scientific structure and avoid misleading comparisons.

    ### Scientific Understanding Today  
    Modern research shows homeopathic remedies contain **nanoparticles** of the original source material even at high dilutions (IIT-Bombay studies).

    These nanoparticles interact with biological systems through:  
    - Modulation of immune responses  
    - Cellular signaling pathways  
    - Regulation of stress proteins  
    - Epigenetic modulation  

    ### Evidence From Studies  
    - Research shows effects in allergies, inflammation, and chronic conditions.  
    - Controlled trials demonstrate symptomatic improvement in certain diseases.

    ### Integrative Approach  
    Scientific homeopathy combines classical principles with modern analytical techniques, making it a credible holistic therapy.

        question: "What Doctors Should Know About Homeopathy?",
        answer: `

    • Minimal side effects  
    • Complements conventional treatment in chronic cases  
    • Strengthens immunity and reduces relapse tendencies  
    • Useful in patients sensitive to strong allopathic medications

    • Homeopathy provides holistic healing without suppressing symptoms.  
    • It is especially effective in chronic, repeated, or stress-aggravated conditions.  
    • Helps restore emotional balance alongside physical health.

    **Vital Force**  
    • The core energy that maintains balance in the body.  
    • Disease appears when the vital force is disturbed.  
    • Remedies help restore this internal harmony.

    **Miasms (Chronic Disease Patterns)**  
    • Inherited or long-standing patterns of illness.  
    • Explain why some conditions relapse or don’t heal easily.  
    • Major miasms: Psora, Sycosis, Syphilis.  
    • Modern interpretation links them to genetics and immunity.

    **Constitution**  
    • Each person has a unique mind-body makeup.  
    • Includes temperament, habits, emotions, physical traits, sensitivities.  
    • Constitutional remedies provide profound long-term healing.

    **Why These Concepts Matter**  
    • Enable personalized treatment  
    • Help understand emotional + genetic contribution to disease  
    • Ensure long-lasting recovery rather than temporary relief
