Homeopathy treats the root cause, not just symptoms.  \r\n    - Remedies stimulate the body's natural healing mechanism.  \r\n    - Emotional, physical, and lifestyle factors are considered.  \r\n    - Medicines are safe, non-toxic, and suitable for all ages.\r\n\r\n    ### Why It Matters  \r\n    Homeopathy aims to restore long-term health by correcting internal imbalances.  \r\n    It is widely used for chronic conditions, allergies, emotional issues, and lifestyle disorders.\r\n\r\n  `,\r\n    reference: \"Source: Faculty of Homeopathy, UK\"\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  {\r\n    question: \"What Homeopathy is NOT\",\r\n    answer: `\r\n    ### Clearing Common Misconceptions  \r\n    Many people confuse homeopathy with other natural systems.  \r\n    Homeopathy is **not** synonymous with Ayurvedic oils, herbal remedies, or dietary supplements.\r\n\r\n    ### Homeopathy Is NOT:  \r\n    -
