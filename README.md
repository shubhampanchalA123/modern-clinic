# HairGrowth Clinic - Next.js Starter

This is a minimal Next.js + Tailwind + Framer Motion scaffold for a hair-growth clinic flow:
Register -> Stage selection -> Plans -> Coach.

How to run:
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Open http://localhost:3000

Notes:
- Replace SVG placeholders in /public/images with real assets.
- Tailwind is already configured to pick up pages and components.
